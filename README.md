Automatically turn Amazon links on your blog into deep links that open the click into the amazon app - 3-5X more likely to buy.

== Description ==

[Grocers List](https://grocerslist.com) is a suite of tools built for food and recipe bloggers. The plugin makes it super easy to start earning more from the existing Amazon affiliate links published on your posts. Connect the plugin to your existing grocers list account, and we’ll quickly find all amazon links published on your site.

We’ll then automatically convert them into deep links for Amazon. When clicked, it will bring the visitor into their Amazon app on their phone, where they have the highest likelihood of converting. Driving clicks into the Amazon app, rather than into Amazon in the browser, converts 3-5X more.
