Earn more revenue from your website by offering paid memberships, exclusive content, and amazon deep links.

== Description ==

[Grocers List](https://grocerslist.com) is a suite of tools built for food and recipe bloggers. The plugin makes it super easy to start earning more revenue form your website traffic through our two plugin based services:

## Paid Memberships

Offer website visitors access to an ad-free cooking experience by joining your membership program. Offer paid members exclusive access to specific recipe posts, or exclusive recipe cards. Easily set your membership price, customize your membership display settings, and we will handle the paid membership checkout, member logins, and member exclusive content gating. Open up a predictable, recurring revenue stream on top of your existing content site, rather than pushing your audience into substack.

## Amazon Deep links

Earn more from the existing Amazon affiliate links published on your posts. Connect the plugin to your existing grocers list account, and we’ll quickly find all amazon links published on your site.
We’ll then automatically convert them into deep links for Amazon. When clicked, it will bring the visitor into their Amazon app on their phone, where they have the highest likelihood of converting. Driving clicks into the Amazon app, rather than into Amazon in the browser, converts 3-5X more.
